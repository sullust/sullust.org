# Bash's command substitution syntax to store the results of the tput command

# Stores the number of lines or rows on the terminal display
#max_lines=$(tput lines)

# Stores the number of columns on the terminal display
#max_cols=$(tput cols)

# Clear the screen
#echo $term_clear

# The outer while loop starts at 0 and loops till MAXSIZE, creating a passwd char each iteration.
# The shells $RANDOM variable creates a semi-random unsigned number. This is our entropy. =x
# x simply holds some random unsigned int that will be used to make the character scramble.
# 500 was choosen for speed and nothing else. Leave out the mod 500 if you want or change it.
# The inner loop displays the password characters. Tput keeps the cursor in the proper position.
# Mod MODNUM keeps the random number inside the size of the array so it doesnt over index.
